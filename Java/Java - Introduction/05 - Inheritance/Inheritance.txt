What is inheritance?
      Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.
Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.
