From a high level, Struts2 is a pull-MVC (or MVC2) framework. The Model-ViewController pattern in Struts2 is implemented with the following five core components −

1. Actions
2. Interceptors
3. Value Stack / OGNL
4. Results / Result types
5. View technologies

You can understand the work flow through user's request life cycle in Struts 2 as follows −

1. User sends a request to the server for requesting for some resource (i.e. pages).

2. The Filter Dispatcher looks at the request and then determines the appropriate Action.

3. Configured interceptor functionalities applies such as validation, file upload etc.

4. Selected action is performed based on the requested operation.

5. Again, configured interceptors are applied to do any post-processing if required.

6. Finally, the result is prepared by the view and returns the result to the user.
