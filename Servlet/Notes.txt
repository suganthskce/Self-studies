Servlet technology is used to create web application (resides at server side and generates dynamic web page).
Servlet technology is robust and scalable because of java language. Before Servlet, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting language was popular as a server-side programming language.

There are many interfaces and classes in the servlet API such as Servlet, GenericServlet, HttpServlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse etc.

A web application is an application accessible from the web. A web application is composed of web components like Servlet, 
JSP, Filter etc. and other components such as HTML. The web components typically execute in Web Server and respond to HTTP request.
